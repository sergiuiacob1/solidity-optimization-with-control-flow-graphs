Blockchain has seen an increased popularity over the last few years. With more and more decentralized, scalable applications in the cloud, the software engineering industry has also seen an increase in blockchain development requests. It is futile to deny the revolutionary aspects of the Blockchain network, as it is usually the case with many new technologies in the market.

One of the keys for great software engineering is working with great, efficient tools â€“ that is, the better, faster, more secure a programming language is, the better the final product is. In this thesis, we'll explore on how we can make Solidity, a programming language for developing smart contracts on the Blockchain, more efficient in building its bytecode and deploying the smart contracts in the network.

By the means of this work, we expect to see small improvements in the static analysis and compilation of the code, which in the end, multiplied by the hundreds of thousands of smart contracts compiled daily, might result in huge cost savings in the cloud.
