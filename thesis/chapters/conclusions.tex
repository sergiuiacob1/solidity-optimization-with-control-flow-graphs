Solidity is still a place where "construction is in progress". What's common across optimizing all of the versions of this programming language is common software techniques, known as static analysis. Control Flow Graphs are a center piece of this mechanism and represents a good starting point, even more valuable when augmented by ASTs and other intermediate representations of the code, such as op code or YUL.

State of the art in Smart Contract Optimization is still receiving inputs, modifications, enhancements from many parts as parties, as the programming language itself is still under heavy development.
