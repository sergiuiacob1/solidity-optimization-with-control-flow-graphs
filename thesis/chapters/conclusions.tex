\chapter{Conclusions} 

\paragraph*{}
Optimization is a common process done in compilers that will continue to gain interest from the research and development community. As seen in some of the examples, it can make resource usage even four times lower, while not sacrificing the accessability that high level code brings. Statically typed programming languages usually end up as being preferable in the later phases of program development, as they enforce strict type usage, give little room for interpretation, have an extra layer of security thanks to static analysis (eg. it can automatically detect runtime issues through symbolic execution) and lastly, but definitely not least, generate efficient bytecode thanks to compilers.

\paragraph*{}
Solidity is still a place where "construction is in progress". Thanks to the possibility of external contributions, effective handling of edge cases was implemented directly in the official compiler's codebase, giving seamless integration with the ecosystem. We've managed to have better gas usage for specific smart contracts, while maintaining the corectness of the data flow analysis step. Further work consists in merging the above enhancements through isolated PRs in Solidity's codebase.
