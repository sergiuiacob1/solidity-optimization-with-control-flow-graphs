\chapter{Contributions}

Solidity is a relatively new technology, when compared to already existing programming languages widely used in the market. As stated by the Solidity team itself, "the optimizer is under heavy development" \cite{solidity-documentation}, which gives plenty of room for contributors to bring their own performance enhancements.

I plan on being one of those contributors, starting from the Solidity code and the AST built by the Solidity compiler itself. I will then evaluate the given inputs and focus on building a specific, low resolution Control Flow Graph, by which memory allocation and cpu cycles can be thoroughly inspected. This would allow for a technical deep dive into the insides of an Ethereum smart contract, which in return can provide useful insights to the user as to how the code can be optimized.

As compared to the other existing tools, this thesis will focus on the latest stable version of Solidity (0.8) and will be built around a set principles focused on scalable, maintainable code analysis tools. Security will also not be the main concern, as there is already plenty of interest in that area.
